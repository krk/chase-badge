### hardware rev10:

- Use cheaper 0402WGF715JTCE instead of ARG02FTC71R5 for 71.5 ohm resistors.
- Use TPS63001, which is in stock, instead of TPS63000 to reduce parts count by removing R73 and R74.

### hardware rev9:

- J1 4-pin FPC connector not in stock, replaced with 6 pin.
- Moved USB signals to PB0 and PB2, exposed both on J1. With these pins, add-on boards can optionally use I2C.
- Use cheaper 0402WGF4300TCE instead of ARG02FTC4300 for 430 ohm resistors.

### hardware rev8:

- Initial import.
