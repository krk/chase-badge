### hardware rev9:

- J1 4-pin FPC connector not in stock, replaced with 6 pin.
- Moved USB signals to PB0 and PB2, exposed both on J1. With these pins, add-on boards can optionally use I2C.
- Use cheaper 0402WGF4300TCE instead of ARG02FTC4300 for 430 ohm resistors.

### hardware rev8:

- Initial import.
